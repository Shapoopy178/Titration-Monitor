# Titration Monitor

This repository includes the code for control and monitoring of an automated chemical titration monitoring system. The titration monitoring system was designed to detect the change in voltage across a photoresistor-based voltage divider caused by the change in absorbance of a colorimetric indicator used in the titration experiment being monitored. The basic setup of such a monitoring system consists of an Arduino Uno, a photoresistor-based voltage divider, and an LED of an appropriate color to detect the color shift of the indicator species. 

## Motivation

Frankly, I made this code as a school project and do not expect it will ever be used again. It is therefore preserved here for austerity purposes only. 

That said, the stated goal of the school project was the development of a "novel" measurement system using only components and software compatible with the Arduino prototyping platform. The resultant titration monitor accomplishes the goal of the project in the following ways:
 * It uses only code and components compatible with the Arduino platform
 * It has been demonstrated to be a viable, if imprecise, method for the monitoring and automated control of a standard acid-base titration experiment.
 * It may be employed to perform a measurement or task for which no convenient system already exists on the market
 
 # Info
 ## Build
 * Written in ArduinoIDE, version 1.8.5
 * Tested on Arduino Uno r3
 ## Features
 * Capable of roughly monitoring optical absorbance of a solution placed between photoresistor-based voltage divider and appropriately colored LED
